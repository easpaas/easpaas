# Hello 👋 

I'm Evan, a Web Developer, who is passionate about creating technology to elevate people and build community. 

I enjoy learning and discovering new technologies, but my bread and butter range from semantic HTML, CSS with preprocessors like less and sass, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Postgres, SQLite3, and MongoDB. 

I am also a coffee nerd, bicycle enthusiast, and an aficionado of simplicity.
